RFID app and native service introduction and usage:


1 The app work flow:
  IPtrak app(or monzax_app) -> JNI lib --|--> native service lib(operate the device node here) --|--> monzax driver
2 For native service support:
  There are 2 file of the native service feature, one is "libmonzax_service.so", the other is binary named as "rfid_monzaxd"
3 For kernel/bootimg which include the monzax driver, it needs the bootimg included the monzax driver by default.
  If it is not in the weekly release, needs to provide it locally.
4 For RFID app, it included the JNI lib.
  Because of native service added, the jni part also have changed, there is one patch for it.
